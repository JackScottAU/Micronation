Nothing to see here, move along...

Just a thought exercise on running my own country with a constitution and so on. Legal documents are exactly why we need version control!

The only claim a monarch can have for their power is the devine right of kings. If you do not believe in God, you cannot have a monarchy. Other problem with monarchy: most are not monarchies because monarch is under law, not above it. True monarch rules above the law.
